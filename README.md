## Installation [examples on Linux@Ubuntu]

Note:
The `dev` branch is the development version of RP2 and it may be unstable. To use the latest stable version, download it from the [Releases](https://github.com/Hojagulyyev/rp2/releases/) page or switch to a release tag.

### Terminal 1
The fastest way to develop with RP2 is by using python [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) library

install virtualenv if it's not installed

`pip install virtualenv`

and run the following commands:

`git clone -b main https://github.com/Hojagulyyev/rp2.git`

`cd rp2`

`virtualenv venv`

`. source/bin/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python manage.py makemigrations`

`python manage.py migrate`

`python manage.py runserver`

### Terminal 2

Just installing Celery, however, isn‚Äôt enough. 
If you attempt to run the task queue, you‚Äôll notice that Celery first 
seems to start up fine but then displays an error message that 
indicates that Celery can‚Äôt find a message broker.

`sudo apt install redis`

Open another terminal or linux service in server
and run celery workers

`celery -A rp2 worker --loglevel=info`

### Terminal 3

Open another terminal or linux service. 
You should change permission access mode (chmod) of these files

`chmod -R 777 celerybeat-schedule venv`

and run celery beat

`celery -A rp2 beat`

You‚Äôve successfully arranged the puzzle pieces necessary to run the project.
